Final Web Dev Assignment 
# Name- Solomon Tesfaye
# How I Made It
- Making my website portfolio was really fun! I learned how to build it step by step.

- First, I took the design I made for my UX project and thought about how I wanted my website to look and work.
- Then, I used Bootstrap 5 to help me create the navigation menu and speed up the process.
- After that, I added animations with animate.css, which made elements move and look more engaging. I also used Remixicon for icons, to make it more attractive and engaging.
- I made sure everything looked good on phones, tablets, and computers by using responsive design.(media query)
- In the end, I made website to show off my work and skills!

# Challanges 
- A big challenge I faced was implementing a dark mode toggle. When I switched to dark mode, the text and headings didn't change color properly. So, I had to come up with a solution, like adding a class name for the paragrghs and heading to fix it and make everything look right in dark mode.
- The second challenge I encountered when creating my web portfolio was with the layout of the images on my work page. I noticed that the images had different sizes, which caused the alignment to be uneven. To fix this, I used CSS to adjust the size of the image cards by adding margin-bottom and setting a specific width. Additionally, I used a cropping tool to ensure that all images were the same size, creating a more uniform and visually appealing layout.

# What I Learned
 Creating this portfolio taught me many things such as:
- Using Bootstrap: I became proficient at using Bootstrap and customizing it to make my portfolio look exactly how I wanted.
- Design Skills: I've become really good at making websites look great by playing with shadows, mixing colors, and presenting them in a stylish way.
# Resources I Used
- Bootstrap 5: Frameworks for building websites.
- Animate.css: Adds special effects to make my logo on my website move.
- Remixicon: Provides lots of cool icons to decorate my website.
