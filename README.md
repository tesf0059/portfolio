Final Web Dev Assignment 
# Name- Solomon Tesfaye
# How I Made It
- First, I planned how it should look and function, similar to sketching a blueprint before building. Then, I used Bootstrap 5, like a set of ready-made Lego pieces, to speed up the process. It helped me piece everything together neatly and ensured it looked good on all devices.

- To make it more attrctive I added animations with animate.css, which made elements move and look more engaging. I also used Remixicon for icons, like adding fun icons to decorate my Logo.

- A big challenge I faced was implementing a dark mode toggle. When I switched to dark mode, the text and headings didn't change color properly. So, I had to come up with a solution, like adding a class name for the paragrghs and heading to fix it and make everything look right in dark mode.

# What I Learned
 Creating this portfolio taught me many things such as:
- Using Bootstrap: I became proficient at using Bootstrap and customizing it to make my portfolio look exactly how I wanted.
- Design Skills: I learned about making things look nice and easy to use for people who visit my portfolio.
- Collaboration: I learned how to use tools like Git and GitHub to work with others on the same project and keep track of changes.
# Resources I Used
- Bootstrap 5: Frameworks for building websites.
- Animate.css: Adds special effects to make my logo on my website move.
- Remixicon: Provides lots of cool icons to decorate my website.
